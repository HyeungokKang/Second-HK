  <h2> Project Abstract </h2>
  <p> My final project is a web-based robotics learning environment for kindergarteners. The project uses screen-based resources and tangible robots, called Beebots and Cubelets, to engage children as they learn problem-solving skills. A key feature of the project is children's autonomous and interactive learning using technology. </p>
  <p> This design project highlights three main concepts: learner perspective, learner interests, and the value of tacit knowledge. This project will provide safe trial-and-error learning opportunities for students by incorporating imaginary elements based on children's pop cultures and stories. </p>
